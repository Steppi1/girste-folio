I’m a designer from Korea, based in Brooklyn, New York. I create visual identities for brands big and small, with a focus on typography and strategy. I graduated with a BFA in Design at the School of Visual Arts in 2019. Currently at Gretel, previously at ETC, Hinterland, and Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv. My work has been recognized by the Type Director’s Club, Art Director’s Club, and Graphis. Feel free to reach out about freelance work, potential collaboration, or just to say hi ♥
Mountain Hardwear
A new identity for an outdoor wear brand, brought to life with an evolution of the logo, new art direction, brand color, and a custom typographic family, based on the iconic geometric elements of the Mountain Hardwear nut. Marrying the adventurous spirit and responsible craftsmanship of outdoor equipment, we anchored the brand personality in a dynamic tension between wild and wise.

Brooklyn Historical Society: 400 Years of Inequality
For the entire month of October 2019, the Brooklyn Historical Society hosted panels, screenings, and events to reflect on the past four centuries of U.S. history and the persisting consequences of racial inequality since the arrival of slavery. The inequality symbol was a direct and literal identifier for the event, with the inverted colors alluding to the layers of the ramifications of slavery.
